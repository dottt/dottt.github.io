`...` (pronounced "dot dot dot") is a place for people and ideas, most likely involving technology of some sort, but not necessarily so. it does not have any particular topic, instead, there will be a starting point and we'll see what happens after that.

- intro to signal processing (please make these fourier things less scary)
