# ...

`...` (pronounced "dot dot dot") is a place for people and ideas, most likely involving technology of some sort, but not necessarily so. it does not have any particular topic, instead, there will be a starting point and we'll see what happens after that.

## ... #1 - generative art

## Ideas for topics

- datomic (and a related secret project of mine)
- prolog
- microKanren
- gzip (alteratively: how file formats work, pngs, jpegs, ... would also be interesting)
- intro to signal processing (please make these fourier things less scary)
- backup 101:
  - how to make full system backups *and* restore them using `dd{,_rescue}`
  - (sophisticated) backup of `/home/$USER` via `rsync` (and piping through `xz`)
  - what are the pros and cons of both methods?
  - how to backup/restore docker containers?
  - why do [I need backups](http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/recovery.html) in the first place?
